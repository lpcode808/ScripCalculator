This was created with the help of AI. I learned a lot!

While I am no longer currently working at Punahou, I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of the community. Mahalo to all who have kept in touch. This is my token of appreciation for you. Until we meet again!

If you have ideas for simple web apps, I'm curious about how it might be made!
