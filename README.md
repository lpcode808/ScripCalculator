## FAQs
  **Q: "Are you going to see all the things I buy at carnival?"**
  
  A: Nope. The calculator runs entirely in your browser (on your phone or
  computer). Think of it like the calculator app on your phone: it does the math on
  your device and doesn’t send your selections anywhere.

  **Q: How does the dollar total work now that scrip is $1?**
  
  A: Each scrip is $1, and scrip is sold in sheets of 10. So the cash total rounds
  up to the nearest sheet ($10 increments).

  **Q: Do I need internet to use it?**
  
  A: You need internet to load the page and menu data. After it’s loaded, the
  calculations run locally in your browser.

  **Q: Where do the prices live / how do I update them?**
  
  A: Prices are in `data/menu.json`. Update the file and refresh the page.

  **Q: Is this the official carnival menu?**
  
  A: No — this is a community tool. If you need official info, check the [official
  carnival](https://carnival.punahou.edu/) sources.

This was created with the help of AI. I learned a lot!

While I am no longer currently working at Punahou, I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of the community. Mahalo to all who have kept in touch. This is my token of appreciation for you. Until we meet again!

If you have ideas for simple web apps, I'm curious about how it might be made!
