# Implementation Log

## 2025-01-29 09:42:36 HST - Initial Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Local Development Setup
1. Create basic file structure:
   ```
   ScripCalculator/
   ├── index.html
   ├── css/
   │   └── styles.css
   ├── js/
   │   └── main.js
   └── data/
       └── menu.json
   ```

### Why This Structure:
- **Separation of Concerns**: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JS for logic
- **Maintainability**: Each component in its own file for easier updates
- **Scalability**: Data-driven approach with menu.json for easy menu updates
- **Simple to Test**: Can be tested with any local server without build steps

### Next Steps:
1. Create the basic file structure
2. Move HTML from plan.md to index.html
3. Extract CSS to separate file
4. Setup local testing environment using Python's built-in HTTP server
5. Basic GitHub Pages setup

### Testing Strategy:
- Local testing using Python's `http.server` (simplest approach)
- No build tools needed initially
- Can be deployed directly to GitHub Pages

### Initial Focus:
- Get basic structure working with mock data
- Implement core calculation logic
- Ensure mobile-responsive design
- Test cross-browser compatibility

Will proceed with Phase 1 upon confirmation. Key questions before proceeding:
1. Should we keep the emoji icons in the category headers?
2. Do we need to support offline functionality?
3. Should we implement order history storage?

## 2025-01-29 09:42:45 HST - Initial Implementation Complete

### Completed Tasks:
1. Created basic file structure
2. Implemented menu data structure in JSON
3. Created responsive CSS with modern styling
4. Implemented core JavaScript functionality
5. Created main HTML structure

### Next Steps:
1. Test locally using Python's HTTP server
2. Verify calculations are working correctly
3. Test responsive design on different devices
4. Setup GitHub repository for deployment

To test locally, we'll need to run a simple HTTP server. Would you like me to help you set that up now?
